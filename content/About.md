When you are reading papers or textbooks filled with math derivations, you probably have came across phrases 
like 'it can be readily seen that ...' or 'it's obvious that ...'. Sometimes, the results follow are indeed obvious, but 
other times, you end up spending hours scratching your head and googling stuff, trying to unravel the mystery of what's 
supposed to be 'obvious'. If you can relate to this, then I'm sure you would understand the joy of stumbling upon an 
online document that thoroughly explains how the results were derived. This pretty much summarizes the motivation of this 
blog. In general, I try to fill the 'derivation blank' of the 'obvious' results that I have encountered during my learning.
My goal is to share insights and strategies that I've gathered, making the information more accessible and straightforward.

By the way, my name is Zhenhuan, and I also go by the name Steven, see you in a bit :)

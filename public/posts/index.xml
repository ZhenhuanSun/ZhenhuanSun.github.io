      <description>Not long ago, I came across this interesting paper, which explored the possibility of training a neural network that embeds a constrained quadratic optimization problem as one of its layers. I was immediately hooked on the idea and began exploring it in the paper. However, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t describe the experience of reading that paper as enjoyable, mainly because the authors assumed readers were already familiar with some theorems from real analysis, and many derivation details for the results presented in the paper were missing.</description>
